# Task_4 Firewall Configuration

## üîç Objective
Configure and test basic firewall rules to allow or block traffic on the system.

## üõ† Tools Used
- UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
- Overleaf
- Linux, Windows (OS)

## üß™ Steps Performed
1. Installed UFW using **sudo apt install ufw**
2. Setup a rule for denying incoming telnet(port 23) traffic on the system
3. Remote connection from another system through port 23
4. Setup another rule for allowing incoming ssh(port 22) traffic on the system
5. Remote connection from another system through port 22
6. Reset the UFW

## üìä Output
- Incoming telnet connection is blocked to the system when a deny rule is applied on the firewall.
- SSH connection was successful when port 22 was enabled on the firewall.
- Exchanged information between systems using SSH
